I'm Dhanush Balakrishna, a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Currently, I'm expanding my expertise by pursuing an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Algorithms at Northeastern University, Boston. 


My professional journey has led me through dynamic and innovative roles, notably at SandLogic Technologies Pvt. Ltd., where I spearheaded the development of cutting-edge solutions for object detection, segmentation, face recognition, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), catering to a plethora of computing environments. This journey has been characterized by my ability to architect and deploy robust training and inference pipelines, a testament to my deep understanding of AI technologies.

Currently, I'm embracing the role of a Machine Learning Intern at SolBid Incorporated, where I'm channeling my skills towards the renewable energy sector. Here, I'm leveraging Google APIs and PHP to craft a pioneering estimation tool for Rooftop Solar Planning, along with using Machine Learning to detect obstacles on a rooftop using satellite imagery and object detection. This role has not only broadened my technical horizon but also underscored the transformative impact of AI in fostering sustainable energy solutions.

My tenure at SandLogic Technologies Pvt. Ltd. as a Machine Learning Research Engineer allowed me to significantly contribute to projects optimizing deep learning models for edge devices, notably enhancing object detection models' efficiency and reducing computational requirements without sacrificing accuracy. These projects underscored my proficiency with tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch, and OpenCV, and honed my skills in neural network optimization and on-device AI deployment.

With a foundational education in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University, complemented by a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication from Visvesvaraya Technological University, my academic and practical experiences converge to form a solid expertise in AI. This expertise is further enriched by my involvement in projects ranging from neural machine translation to visual SLAM and enhanced photo mosaicking at Northeastern University, reflecting my continuous pursuit of knowledge and innovation in AI.

Beyond my technical endeavors, I'm passionate about photography, video editing and sound design, hobbies that allow me to explore creativity beyond the realm of code.

I welcome opportunities to collaborate and connect with fellow professionals and enthusiasts in the field of AI. Please feel free to reach out to me at [dhanushbalakrishna45@gmail.com](mailto:dhanushbalakrishna45@gmail.com).
